On the basis of previous research on ego depletion, decision-making and risk-behaviour, this study inspects the impact of ego depletion on social risk-behaviour in the context of consumer decision-making. The Experiment examined whether ego depletion restricts an experimental group mentally, on the assumption of social risk, to an extent where subsequent decisions will be significantly risk-averse, risk affine or indifferent. Even though the results showed a tendency of risk-averse behaviour under ego depletion, statistical analysis of the collected data could neither confirm nor fully reject a dependency between ego depletion and decision-making when it comes to social risk.
