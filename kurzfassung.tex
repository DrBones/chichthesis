On the basis of previous research on ego depletion, decision-making and risk behaviour, this study inspects the impact of ego-depletion on social risk behaviour in the context of con-sumer decision-making. The Experiment examined whether ego depletion restricts an experi-mental group mentally, on the assumption of social risk, to an extent where subsequent deci-sions will be significantly risk-averse, risk affine or indifferent. Even though the results showed a tendency of risk-averse behaviour under ego depletion, statistical analysis of the collected data could neither confirm nor fully reject a dependency between ego depletion and decision-making when it comes to social-risk.
